- 👋 Hi, I’m @CyberKrul. Irl, I go by Etienne Zubin Fernandes.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pyspark, PyTorch and MLOPs, besides ruminating over what I've done before. Sooo much to learn, so little time ;-;
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to help me improve my understanding and tech skills, especially MLOPs. Would love some to work on some PyTorch related projects as well!!
- 📫 How to reach me :ferdy48.ef@gmail.com. Please feel free to ask me about my work, notes or collab possibilities

- Have a great day stranger, wonder over yonder when you can!
